# Human Aladdin – Core Philosophy

Human Aladdin is a non-predictive decision guardrail system.

It does not tell people what to do.
It does not predict outcomes.
It exists to reduce irreversible mistakes.

## Three Integrated Ideas

### 1. I Ching (易經) – State Awareness
I Ching is not used for fortune telling.
It is used to identify the current state and position of a system.

### 2. Aladdin – Anti-Wish Design
Human Aladdin never grants wishes.
It reveals costs, limits, and constraints before actions are taken.

### 3. Pendulum Effect – Extremes Create Rebounds
Extreme actions often produce extreme corrections.
Human Aladdin highlights overextension and imbalance.

## Core Principle
Human Aladdin protects human agency by defining boundaries, not directions.
